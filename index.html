            Natural wine, as a culture is rooted in the philosophy of minimal
            intervention and a deep appreciation for the environment and
            ecology. It revolves around the idea of allowing grapes to express
            their true, unadulterated character by avoiding synthetic chemicals
            and additives. Natural winemakers place a premium on sustainable
            farming practices, organic or biodynamic viticulture, and
            noninterventionist wine-making techniques.This holistic approach
            consistently yields wines that showcase a sense of place, with
            unique and unpredictable flavors, while also fostering a sense of
            community among producers and enthusiasts who share a passion for
            wines made with a lighter touch.

        <div>
          <p>
            The taste difference between natural wine and traditional wine can
            be quite distinct mainly due to their contrasting production methods
            and philosophies. Traditional wines are often more standardized and
            consistent in flavor. Winemakers using conventional methods aim for
            a stable product with less variation from year to year, making them
            more predictable due to utilizing additives such as sulfites,
            commercial yeast, and a filtration and fining process. Natural wines
            often exhibit a broader spectrum of flavors and aromas, with a focus
            on showcasing the unique characteristics of the grape variety and
            the terroir (environmental factors like soil and climate). They can
            be more unpredictable and may have subtle nuances that change with
            each vintage.
